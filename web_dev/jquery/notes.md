I've previously learned a bit of jQuery before but a refresher is always welcome. I've come to collect a bundle of easy to understand resources for learning jQuery, including Codecademy's jQuery course (for a good onboarding session), perusing through jQuery Codepens to see jQuery in actual development application, and reading on how it works in relation to vanilla JavaScript.
I think in my endeavors as a UX Designer (and soon to be UX Developer), having an extensive understanding of jQuery will be very essential for my needs! Fortunately, I have purchased a book that showcases jQuery usages in UX and UI capacities.

Briefly revisited Codecademy's jQuery lesson but found it to be very basic. Then, I found CodeSchool's free lesson on jQuery: http://try.jquery.com/

They go into more specific detail with the explanations of traversing the DOM and how to manipulate within it.
